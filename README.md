MyToken

This is a simple ERC20 token contract written in Solidity. It has the following features:

A public name and symbol
A total supply of tokens
A mapping of addresses to balances
A mint function that allows the contract owner to create new tokens
A burn function that allows users to destroy tokens

How to use

To use this contract, you will need to deploy it to a compatible blockchain. Once it is deployed, you can interact with it using a web3 wallet or other compatible tool.

To mint tokens, you will need to call the mint function with the address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to mint. For example:

contract MyToken(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
totalSupply += amount;
balances[recipient] += amount;
}

To burn tokens, you will need to call the burn function with your address and the amount of tokens to burn. For example:

contract MyToken(address sender, uint256 amount) public {
require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
require(balances[sender] >= amount, "Not enough balance");
totalSupply -= amount;
balances[sender] -= amount;
}
